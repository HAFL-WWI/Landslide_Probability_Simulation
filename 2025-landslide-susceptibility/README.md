# Optimisation and application of a high-resolution shallow landslide model at regional scale (2025)
This folder contains the code used for data preparation, simulation, and result analysis used in the publication. Note that that only summary data needed to recreate the publication graphics is included:
- __python__: This folder contains code used for input data preparation, running the senstitivity analysis, running the parameter optimization, running the application at catchment scale, and the result analysis. See the separate readme files for further details.
- __r__: This folder contains a R script and trained models for generating a raster with the predicted failure depth during data preparation.
