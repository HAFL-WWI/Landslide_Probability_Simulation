# Failure depth preparation code
The R script in this folder builds upon the inputs created by the code accompanying Schaller et al. (2025) that is available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14228477). The peprocessed covariate rasters from that code are used as input for the prediction. The trained Random Forest models are included in the folder.
